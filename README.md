# Welcome to Brick-by-Brick
This repository is my prototype for the Brick-by-Brick website.

The goal of the site is to make digitally cataloging LEGO collections into a reality, with a focus on keeping everything, including the design, “simple, clean, and fun.” The client involved in this project, needs a solution to keep track of his LEGO sets in a digital format, and wants to display his collection online.

Our team have worked closely with the client to develop two solutions that are now in the prototyping stage. Following on with our development plan, we will turn these designs into a complete, functioning web application in 2023.

This prototype is built using HTML, SCSS, and JavaScript. The site itself, and the logo, have been designed and developed by me. All images featured on this site are either original photos taken by the client, or free images from Unsplash.com. For the purpose of including testing data about each of the LEGO sets, some of the descriptions and details have come from LEGO.com and were not originally written by me.
